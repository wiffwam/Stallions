When can I buy marijuana?
Because the details of legalization have fallen to the provinces
that depends on where you are in Canada. 
In Alberta, recreational cannabis will be widely available 
at 17 private retailers across the province, 
while in Ontario sales will be exclusively online until later in the year. 
Most of the other provinces are a blend of these two approaches; 
in Newfoundland and Labrador, you will be able to buy weed at 
stores run by the province’s liquor board. Few of the country’s 
suddenly ubiquitous (and illegal) marijuana dispensaries 
are likely to survive the transition to licensed retailing.
